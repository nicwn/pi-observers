  //
  // Use the TYPED options `systemPrompt` / `appendSystemPrompt`, NOT the
  // `systemPromptOverride` / `appendSystemPromptOverride` pair: those are transform
  // callbacks over whatever pi discovered, not replacements, and relying on them
  // would leave the discovery itself running. Had the observer prompt silently
  // failed to apply, every observer would run with pi's default CODING-AGENT
  // system prompt and lose the whole read-only, propose-or-stay-silent framing.
  //
  // `systemPrompt` is a prompt *source*: pi treats it as a file path when one exists
  // at that path and as a literal otherwise. Observer prompts are multi-line prose,
  // never a path, so they resolve as literals. Passing it also suppresses pi's own
  // system-prompt file discovery, which is the point. `appendSystemPrompt: []`
  // likewise suppresses discovery of an append-prompt file (pi only discovers when
  // the option is absent, and an empty array is present); omitting it would let a
  // project's append file leak into every observer.
  // Hermetic on settings too, not just resources. Leaving this unset defaults BOTH
  // DefaultResourceLoader and createAgentSession to `SettingsManager.create(cwd, agentDir)`,
  // which reads the user's real global settings.json AND, per `fromStorage`'s
  // `projectTrusted ?? true`, treats the checked-out repo's project settings as
  // TRUSTED with no trust prompt — widening the same repo-resident-content attack
  // surface `src/slices.ts` exists to sanitize. Concretely, an inherited settings
  // manager would let the host's (or a hostile repo's) settings silently reach every
  // observer session:
  //   - compaction: observer sessions are long-lived by design (context accumulates
  //     across wakes, see below) — a user who disabled auto-compaction would get an
  //     observer whose context grows every turn until the provider rejects the
  //     request, and the bus disables it after 3 silent failures with nothing
  //     pointing at the real cause. Set explicitly here rather than left to inherit.
  //   - retry/timeout settings: a transient provider blip under the host's retry
  //     policy could burn straight through the bus's 3-strike disable budget.
  //   - thinkingBudgets: redefines what `def.thinking` (e.g. "low") actually costs,
  //     so the same observer definition behaves differently for different users.
  // `inMemory` reads no settings file at all, which closes all of the above at once;

  // project file to trust) as defence against a future change to the storage
  // backend, and to state the intent at the call site.
